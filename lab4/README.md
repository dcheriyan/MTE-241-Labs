# Lab 4

The goal of this lab was to gain experience using Message Queues. It was also done to get expeience to see the effects of random losses and differing server and client refresh rates on the message queue.

Personally, I learned a lot about casting pointers and the issues that arise when transferring information between different threads during this lab.
